## Description

a simple visual question answering system, you can use it to add a fun feature to your website or mobile app(or improve it of course)
This Repo is still in very early stage to consider it as a working system, use it on your own.

## Setup

not surprisingly, you have to download some data to use it to train the embedders and the network:
* Word2vec pretrained model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/view (You can use any pretrained model).
* all vqa website datasets : http://visualqa.org/download.html

## Reference

currently working on it.
